Procedure
=========

After downloading the aforementioned files to my daily Linux machine, I checked each's sha256/512 sum against published values, or in the case of the Rust standalone, recorded its sha512 sum and verified its signature file against the project's PGP key from Keybase.

I burnt the Powers of Tau zip, Rust standalone installer, Debian ISO, and Memtest86+ to DVD/CDs; and copied the challenge file to a SanDisk USB drive.

On the compute node (see Side Channel Defences below), I booted from the Debian DVD, installed it to a Samsung USB drive, then booted the machine from the USB drive.

Rust and Powers of Tau were copied from CD. Both sums were re-checked on the compute node. build-essential was installed from the Debian DVD.

I connected Ethernet to run `cargo run --release --bin new` in order to download and configure dependencies. Ethernet was removed once complete, and the resulting challenge file deleted.

The provided challenge file was copied over and computation began. As input, I used the results of two minutes of 20-sided dice rolls, followed by arbitrarily selected words from a book extolling the virtues of laissez-faire capitalism.

One complete, a hash of the response file was taken, copied to the SanDisk USB drive, then uploaded to the AWS bucket via my daily machine.

Side Channel Defences & Postprocessing
======================================

The compute node was a disused 7-year-old Lenovo Thinkpad T420 borrowed from a friend without foreknowledge of my intentions for it.

I removed the hard drive prior to booting the laptop. Although I did not have permission to remove its radio devices, I activated its hardware switch which purportedly disabled them.

Further, during the installation of the Debian instance onto the Samsung USB drive, I declined to install drivers for the machine's wireless devices.

The computation was performed within living quarters with no particular precautions taken save for watching Voyager at formidable volume and inaudibly typing the entropy sources.

After copying the response file and Blake hash to the SanDisk USB drive, I powered off the laptop and booted into the Memtest86+ CD. I allowed Memtest to run for two full cycles (about 1.5 hours) then powered off.

I removed power and battery from the machine and intend to leave it powered off for the foreseable future.

Archival
========

The Debian installation media, Powers of Tau repo, Rust toolchain, and Memtest are on DVD/CDs which I've autographed.

The Samsung USB drive containing the Debian instance, and SanDisk USB drive with challenge and response files (and their hashes), are both LUKS-encrypted. As such, I don't expect these to be tampered with following the operation.

I've sealed all five of the above media in a signed and sealed envelope, which I've locked in a safe to which I alone posses the keys. They are available to audit upon request.
