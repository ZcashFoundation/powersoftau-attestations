Based on my participation in the original ceremony, I was invited to return for this round. Thanks to coordination by Jason Davies, I was able to contribute.

My response for this stage of the Powers of Tau ceremony was processed on a driveless Intel-based (i7-4510U) Tails laptop using the Go implementation (https://github.com/FiloSottile/powersoftau) to increase diversity. 

Building and computation occurred offline, with radios disabled and interfaces down. One-way transfers across a basic airgap were accomplished using one fresh USB stick per direction of movement (a fully-patched Windows 10 system was used as the post-computation transmission system, to increase OS diversity). Given that the enormous number of participants in this round of the ceremony intentionally working to make themselves difficult to attack rule out the practical possibility of a perfect, wall-to-wall ceremony compromise, I assess these less-extreme precautions are adequate to raise the cost of an attack beyond the potential value at risk, and I don't intend to grind down any boards or dump and rehash all the firmware.

After powering off the Tails machine and returning the response to Jason via the transmission system, my stage was completed.
