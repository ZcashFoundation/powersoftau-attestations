Hello! I have uploaded the file.

I used a HP Elitebook 2560, and the Go implementation of Powers of Tau by Filosottile, run on a Centos 7 minimal. I mixed some own entropy to /dev/random.
The taucompute binary was compiled on different machine, a Kali Linux, where I also had to install Go 1.9 and Cmake 3.2 something.
Previously I have tried to compile on the Centos minimal but with latest Cmake the "go install" phase failed with std99 error
(loop initial declaration in the C files),  which I could not desptie trying for hours.
I have used a separate network and compute node, the letter stripped from WiFi, Bluetooth, modem and internal hard drive, booted from SD card.
The computation and the entropy mixing happened in a remote agricultural building with electricity inside.
Files were transferred between nodes via USB with checking the files integrity. Download took 20 minutes and compute around 2.5 hours on the 2 core CPU.
Upload took nearly two hours, and was done with dropbox because the connection to aws broke several times, probably this has something to do with
the quality of the internet connection, an old ADSL.
The contribution happened from a small village : Ozmánbük, Hungary.
This was my second participation after November when I took part with running the Rust implementation.
Thanks everyone for organising and contributing, specially to Jason Davies for his patience :)
