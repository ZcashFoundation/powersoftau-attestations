Running Ubuntu

Procedure:
1. Downloaded rust and powersoftau on online laptop at university

5. Turns out the compute needed to download dependencies...turned laptop wifi on, downloaded dependencies, turn wifi off
6. Grabbed 2 random books off my bookshelf
7. Wrote a small c program that would choose either book 0 or 1, a random page in that book, and a random line # on that page. I then typed that line into the compute program, occasionally pressing random keys between lines
