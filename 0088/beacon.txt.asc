Hash: SHA256

Hi all,

I covered the random beacon in a previous post on the mailing list:
https://lists.z.cash.foundation/pipermail/zapps-wg/2018/000262.html

The security proof for the ceremony requires that a random beacon is
queried and applied at the end, like a simulated participant. The
beacon's output can be somewhat influenced by an adversary, and it won't
impact our security margins much. In any case, it's likely that security
holds even if the beacon is totally compromised, we just haven't had
time to write a proof of this yet. Also, if you think we used a bad
beacon, you can just apply a better beacon yourself.

I still wanted a strong and rigid beacon so there weren't any questions.
This means using one source for the beacon. The strongest source I can
imagine is a "delay function" applied to a Bitcoin block. As long as the
delay function takes a long time to compute with respect to the average
time between Bitcoin blocks (10 minutes) it becomes difficult to argue
that a miner could have influenced the beacon much, if at all.

The ideal delay function is an iterated SHA256 hash over the Bitcoin
block hash. I think 2^42 iterations should be sufficient. (Note that
this is not a proof-of-work function! The hashes are not
parallelizable, so there's a practical limit to how fast this beacon
can be computed on classical hardware.)

The result of the beacon (the SHA256 digest at the end) will seed a
ChaCha20 PRNG. I've written code for the beacon and placed it into my
git repository.

I'll be applying this to the block hash of block #514200.
