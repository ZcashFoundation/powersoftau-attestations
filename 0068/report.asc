My response BLAKE2b.

The compute was done on an old air-gaped desktop. All network devices were
removed from the desktop. I used a Ubuntu 16.04 boot drive that never was reconnected to the internet after the installation and setup was completed. 
After the response was verified, the desktop, keyboard, and all USB devices were destroyed with a hammer. What remains are in a vase on the bar in my apartment.

I plan on adding this blake2b hash on the ZEC and Bitcoin blockchains after I finish miterms and spring break.

Glad to be part of this. Cheers.
