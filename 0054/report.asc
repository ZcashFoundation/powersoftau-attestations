Log
- ---

I decided to participate by producing two consecutive responses,
produced by different machines (named k and j) and implementations.
The plan was to run the Go implementation in parallel on two machines,
after they both finish, choose randomly which response and next
challenge should be used, then use the other machine and the Rust
implementation to produce the second response. See the below log and
diagram for more details on how this actually went.

All times in UTC+1. On 09.02.2018:

- 09:25 - Downloaded challenge file to an external drive.
- 11:50 - Moved to location of machine k.
- 12:00 - Started trying to cross-compile the Go implementation for
          Windows, as machine k only had it installed.
- 12:50 - Gave up on trying to cross-compile, instead downloaded a
          Ubuntu 16.04 live USB.
- 13:00 - Booted up the live USB on machine k, installed Go, compiled
          FiloSottile/powersoftau.
- 13:05 - Copied the challenge file from the external drive to both
          machines.
- 13:07 - Started computation on both machines with the Go
          implementation.
- 14:19 - Machine j finished computing.
- 14:20 - Copied the response of machine j and the next challenge
          produced to the external drive.
- 14:40 - Machine k finished computing.
- 14:45 - Copied the response of machine k and the next challenge
          produced to the external drive.
        - Flipped a coin to select which response of which machine to
          use for further computation, machine j was selected.
- 14:50 - Installed Rust on machine k live USB.
- 14:55 - Started computation on machine k, with the Rust
          implementation, using the challenge produced before by
          machine j.
- 16:40 - Uploaded the first response (produced by machine j).
- 16:45 - Machine k finished computing.
- 17:45 - Uploaded the second response (produced by machine k, based on
          the challenge produced by j first).

    ---> [Machine j] -> response_j       |
                     -> challenge_next_j --> [Machine k] -> response_k2

* response_j and response_k2 were uploaded.
* Machine j is mine, machine k is Jakub's.
