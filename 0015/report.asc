Procedure
=========
I prepared a 2013 Macbook Pro with cargo, powersoftau, and FileVault on
November 15 at my home in Nashville, disabled the radios, and left it
powered off until today.

My turn came up while vacationing in Florida and traveling in a rented car.
This morning, I sat down in the first coffee shop I encountered and used a
second laptop to download the challenge file to a USB stick. Then I copied
the challenge file to my compute machine.

Entropy was generated with about 30 seconds of key-mashing. I allowed it to
run while driving around Homestead and Florida City, leaving the Bluetooth
and Wifi radios disabled. When the process completed, I made a copy of the
response file.

I then performed another computation from Long Pine Key Campground in
Everglades National Park, with entropy generated using the same process.

A coin flip determined which response file to use. The winner was
transferred to USB stick and uploaded to S3 over Verizon 4G LTE from the
campground.

In an effort to overwrite the RAM and run out the battery, I started two
instances of `cargo test`. Add in the South Florida heat, and the fans have
never worked so hard. I intend to leave this computer off for several
weeks, re-format its hard drive, and use it for other purposes in the
future.

Thanks to Sean for coordinating everything, and thanks to the community for
the chance to participate.
